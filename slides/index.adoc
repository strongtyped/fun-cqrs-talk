== Not About

* Akka Typed
* "Function and Reactive Domain Modeling" - Debasish Ghosh

== DDD / CQRS / ES

[%step]
* Aggregate is a *DDD* concept.
	It has a _root_ and zero or more entities and value objects underneath
* Commands and Events are used in CQRS
* Events can be persisted and replayed

=== Event Driven / Sourcing

[%step]
* CQRS is Event Driven, but not necessarily implements Event Sourcing
* in *synchronous* CQRS:
	** tx(Cmd => Aggregate => Event => View)
* in *asynchronous* CQRS:
	** tx(Cmd => Aggregate => Event)
	** tx(Event => View)

== Scala and CQRS

On creation
[source, language="scala"]
Cmd => Event
Event => Aggregate
// therefore we have
Cmd => (Aggregate, Event)

Post-creation
[source, language="scala"]
(Aggregate, Cmd) => Seq[Event]
(Aggregate, Event) => Aggregate
// therefore we have
(Aggregate, Cmd) => (Aggregate, Seq[Event])


=== Async API

On creation
[source, language="scala"]
Cmd => Future[Event]
Event => Aggregate
// therefore we have
Cmd => Future[(Aggregate, Event)]

Post-creation
[source, language="scala"]
(Aggregate, Cmd) => Future[Seq[Event]]
(Aggregate, Event) => Aggregate
// therefore we have
(Aggregate, Cmd) => Future[(Aggregate, Seq[Event])]

=== Async API - inconvenience

On creation
[source, language="scala"]
(cmd:CreateFoo) => Future.successful(FooCreated("foo"))

Post-creation
[source, language="scala"]
(foo:Foo, cmd:ChangeName) => Future.successful(Seq(FooNameChanged("bar")))


=== Sync/Async API - Lift

On creation
[source, language="scala"]
Cmd => Event
Cmd => Future[Event]
// Yeah!!
Cmd => Throwable

Post-creation
[source, language="scala"]
(Aggregate, Cmd) => Event
(Aggregate, Cmd) => Seq[Event]
(Aggregate, Cmd) => Future[Event]
(Aggregate, Cmd) => Future[Seq[Event]]
// Yeah!!
(Aggregate, Cmd) => Throwable

== Akka and DDD/CQRS

[%step]
* Is the Aggregate an Actor?
* Or does it live inside an Actor?
* If it lives inside an Actor, the Actor must know it's hosting an Aggregate
* Akka Persistence for Event Sourcing
* Akka Persistence Query for generating Views
	(experimental)

=== Protocol and Behavior

* Protocol is the set of commands and events for a given Aggregate
* Behavior is the implementation
  ** Conditions to accept commands
  ** Possible failures
  ** Modify Aggregate state

=== Protocol and Behavior

----
include::aggregate-protocol-behavior.txt[]
----

=== AggregateManager

* Create AggregateActors by id
* Forward messages to right AggregateActors
----
include::aggregate-manager.txt[]
----

=== AggregateActor

* AggregateActor is initialized with Behavior of Foo
* Responsible for Foo lifecycle and events storing
----
include::aggregate-actor.txt[]
----
Protocol messages are sent to Actor and applied to Aggregate through its Behavior

=== Projections

[%step]
* We read from the Event Store to produce Views
* Akka Persistence Query new experimental module
* Produces a Reactive Stream source with the selected events

=== Shop Aggregates

[%step]
* Customer
  ** just info from a customer
* Product
  ** create, change name and change price
* Order (references Customer and Products by identifier)
  ** created for a customer
  ** add / remove products
  ** execute / cancel

=== Shop Projections

* Customer Aggregate event -> _CustomerView_
* Product Aggregate event -> _ProductView_
* Customer, Product and Order events -> _OrderView_

=== Problem with OrderViewProjection

What to do with Events from _Customer_ and _Product_?

They will probably arrive before the first order is created.
Should we query the _CustomerViewRepo_ and _ProductViewReop_ whenever we need more info?

Will they reflect the expected state?

=== Solutions

[%step]
1. Have one single event stream and one consumer
2. Implement specific logic for each single event for each view
3. Copy data by reusing existing projections, but saving in another Repository
4. Synchronous views, at least the main views (serious?)
