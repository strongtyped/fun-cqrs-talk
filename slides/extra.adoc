== Domain Driven Design

[%step]
* Popular in OO world, but not only limited to it
* It's all about building a system that 'speaks' a language. The ubiquitous language.

=== DDD - Aggregate

[%step]
* Aggregate central concept in a DDD.
* it has a _root_ and zero or more entities and value objects underneath
* Reponsible for the consistency of underneath objects
* You can only change one Aggregate per transaction

// illustrate with diagram

=== CQRS

[%step]
* Command Query Responsibility Segregation
* Hard to pronnounce acronym
* "It is simply the creation of two objects where there was previously only one" - Greg Young

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Explaing CQS from Bertrand Meyer
CQS puts commands and queries in different methods within a type.
CQRS puts commands and queries on different objects.

=== DDD / CQRS

[%step]
* Aggregates are the Write model
* It receives commands and validate them against current state
* Valid commands are *mapped* to Events that are applied to the Aggregate changing its state
* Events are used to update the Read model (Views)
* Data is modified in a controlled fashion
	(consistency boundary)


=== Event Driven / Sourcing

[%step]
* CQRS is Event Driven, but not necessarily Event Sourcing
* in synchronous CQRS:
	tx(Cmd | Aggregate | Event | View)
* in asynchronous CQRS:
tx(Cmd | Aggregate | Event)
tx(Event | View)
